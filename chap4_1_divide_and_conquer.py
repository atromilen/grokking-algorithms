# In this example, we want to divide a plot of 1680 x 640 metters into squares as big as possible.
# Using Divide & Conquer, we figure out what are the biggest and smallest boxes we can use to divide:
# We need to know that is the smaller box to complete the full 1680 meassurement. 
# i.e. 1680 = 640 + 640 + 400 (this last is smallest box than we can use) 
# This 400 are finded using remainder operation: 1680 % 640 = 400 (remainder)
# Our algorithm ends up with the smallest box possible when the remainder between biggest and 
# smallest will be zero.
# 
# This solution is bassed on EuclideÂ´s algorithm:
